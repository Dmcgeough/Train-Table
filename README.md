# Train-Table
The task this time was our first foray into technology that would use a database. We were to make a dynamic train table which would display the train schedule and the train origin and terminus the time between trains, the time the next train would arrive and how long it would be since your entry the train would arrive. I created a table and a database in firebase. After an entry was made and the submit button was clicked it would append the data to firebase and then display that on the table. It took a long while t figure out how to convert the time correctly and make sure that children would get pushed to firebase and then display where they were supposed to from firebase to the originally empty table. I also had to configure firebase in a way that would make it easy to edit or modify. I also had to create id's for everything and change the style around so Dzmitry would not dock points for style.
Tools used: Firebase, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, Jquery.
